# Homework06-GifTastic



GifTastic is a dynamic webpage that uses a GYPHY API Key to populate Gifs. 





How it works:



*The theme of this page is basketball. There is a list of buttons with different basketball players.

*When the user click on a button, 10 gifs related to this player will be advertised on the page.

*These gifs aren't animated at first until the user click on one of them. When the user click again on that gif, it freezes again.

*The user can also choose to add another button to the list. To do so, the user will use the form Add an player and click on the Submit button. A button with the user choice will be added to the list and a click on it, will show 10 gifs related to the tag on this specific button.
